# Fabulous Fonts

Fabulous bundles [Google Noto Fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) because
they they look good, support a vast number of unicode characters, and have a
sane permissive licence (unlike IndUni-H, DejaVu, MS Fonts, etc.) which is the
SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

Fabulous is still able to read system fonts. But it's nice to have a small set
here that's guaranteed to work.
